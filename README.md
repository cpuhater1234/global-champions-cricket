# Global Champions Cricket

The current release is **GCC v93**. Four supplied cricket figures appear individually as faint watermarks in selected introduction, signing, squad-update and season-review panels. Other surfaces remain plain. The original artwork is embedded unchanged, works offline and is smaller and quieter on phones. v92 heading hierarchy, colourful clubs, framed guides and stacked ground scales are preserved.

Rebuild with `python qa/cricket-watermarks-20261028/build.py --promote`. See [watermark QA](qa/cricket-watermarks-20261028/README.md). All252 screen/width/font checks pass, including unchanged heading/control geometry, all four figures and zero page errors. All20 inline scripts remain byte-identical to v92. Historical builders reproduce historical releases and must not promote the current release.

The following section records the original protected baseline.

This repository starts from the protected **v7.0.14** GCC build and exists to make aggressive QA safer, not to redesign the game.

## Protected baseline

- File: `game/global_champions_cricket_v7_0_14_mobile_interaction_hardened.html`
- Canonical local SHA-256: `04072e8bb361cf3fc7259f058ab22ced7b6da6aa9ec8bf28f457e003e6cf0ac4`
- Newline-normalised SHA-256: `147ac0db30e150a85e60332bd9b56c3e8f9edcdc2226aaed729b737dac40d54c`

The GitHub web upload removed six newline characters at transfer boundaries. The non-newline byte stream is identical to the protected local v7.0.14 file, and each join point was checked as syntactically harmless. No gameplay, simulation, UI or data content changed.

## Working rule

`main` is for promoted, tested builds only. Experimental work belongs on a `qa/...` branch and should be merged only after the relevant regression checks pass.

For every candidate:

1. reproduce the defect or design failure;
2. make the smallest viable change;
3. run targeted QA;
4. run `python qa/check_candidate.py <candidate.html>`;
5. checkpoint the result;
6. only then promote the candidate.

See `docs/WORKFLOW.md` for the operating rules and `qa/GCC_v7014_checkpoint.md` for the recovered v7.0.14 evidence.
