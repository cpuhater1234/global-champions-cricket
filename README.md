# Global Champions Cricket

The current release is **GCC v95**. Signing decisions use compact dark scorebug cards with explicit SIGNED/DECLINED/UPDATE strips and clear player details. Matching player cards throughout drafting and squad planning replace the old cream identity blocks. Club cards, heading hierarchy, subtle cricket art and textured canvas retain their identity.

Rebuild with `python qa/player-tiles-20261028/build.py --promote`. See [player-card QA](qa/player-tiles-20261028/README.md).264 layout cases,12 feed cases and22 targeted contrast states pass.19 inline scripts including simulation and saving remain byte-identical to v94; only the signing-feed presentation script changes. Historical builders reproduce historical releases and must not promote the current release.

The following section records the original protected baseline.

This repository starts from the protected **v7.0.14** GCC build and exists to make aggressive QA safer, not to redesign the game.

## Protected baseline

- File: `game/global_champions_cricket_v7_0_14_mobile_interaction_hardened.html`
- Canonical local SHA-256: `04072e8bb361cf3fc7259f058ab22ced7b6da6aa9ec8bf28f457e003e6cf0ac4`
- Newline-normalised SHA-256: `147ac0db30e150a85e60332bd9b56c3e8f9edcdc2226aaed729b737dac40d54c`

The GitHub web upload removed six newline characters at transfer boundaries. The non-newline byte stream is identical to the protected local v7.0.14 file, and each join point was checked as syntactically harmless. No gameplay, simulation, UI or data content changed.

## Working rule

`main` is for promoted, tested builds only. Experimental work belongs on a `qa/...` branch and should be merged only after the relevant regression checks pass.

For every candidate:

1. reproduce the defect or design failure;
2. make the smallest viable change;
3. run targeted QA;
4. run `python qa/check_candidate.py <candidate.html>`;
5. checkpoint the result;
6. only then promote the candidate.

See `docs/WORKFLOW.md` for the operating rules and `qa/GCC_v7014_checkpoint.md` for the recovered v7.0.14 evidence.
